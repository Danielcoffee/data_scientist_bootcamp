# Supervise learning
- input x then out put y. 
- try many right answer as possible. then will predict other x (never seen before) -> y
- build algorithms like a line, curve, ...
## regression
- given a lot of 'true answer'
- infinite

## Classification
- predict categories: dont have to be number (cat or dog, benign or malignant,...)
- small number of possible output: 0,1, 2 but not contant all possible number as 0.5, 1.7,...

# Unsupervise learning
- Find something interesting in unlabled data.
- Find pattern of structure in this data with out find the y answer.
- Use term clustering algorithms
> *Example*:
- google news

- cost of function: Squared error cost function = J
- goal of linear regression: minimize j(w)
- for the simple version: w ==
